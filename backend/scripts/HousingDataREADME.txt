You can run this ipynb to see how the datasets were modified and combined into one. You need to have the .csv files that are referenced in the journal,
which we did not want to upload directly do github due to their size. Text Evan for him to send you the csv files directly if you would like to work with
this journal and run it, otherwise you can just read through what was happening.
