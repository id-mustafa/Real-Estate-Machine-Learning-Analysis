# Real-Estate-Machine-Learning-Analysis

## Description
Deep Analysis on 3 datasetsâ€“creating one machine learning model per dataset and uncovering findings after semester-long research on the real estate market. Our goal as a team is to uncover something new for the application of machine learning models to the real estate market.

## Development Worflow
Create a seperate branch to develop new features or to investigate an issue. Please follow the branch naming scheme so that the linear history for the project is kept organized. Your branch names should be in the following format:

```
[GitHub-Username]/[issue-#]
```

Write good quality commit messages shorter than 100 characters long that describe what you did in the present tense. Do not use past tense in commit messages, i.e. "Completed...," "Fixed...," "Updated." Instead, say "Complete...," "Fix...," "Update."

Before any push up to GitHub, please review your diffs and ensure that you aren't inentionally pushing anything that isn't supposed to be on the repository.

On making amendments to your PR reviewer's comments, you should practice linking to the commit that specifically addresses the reviewer's comments before requesting a re-review. This helps keep everything running fast and smooth with no hiccups.

Once your branch has been reviewed and merged, you should delete the branch you were working on from the github remote to keep our branch history clean. Do not leave merged branches up on the remote please.

Happy coding!
