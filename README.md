# Real Estate Machine Learning Analysis

The real estate ML analysis project attempts to create a recommendation system of the top places people should live after it has been fed a couple of parameters by a user. The consumer appeal comes from the ability to accurately suggest the best places to live using a neural network. The machine learning innovation of this project is the model's ability to predict other parameters not inputted by a user based on the parameters that they have input.
